      %p.label-53
        Cloud Foundry is an open platform as a service, providing a choice of clouds, developer frameworks and application services. Cloud Foundry makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy and scale applications.

          What we want is to strengthen community networking among our users. It is a lot more fun to learn when you are part of a group. The knowledge pool is bigger and there is a healthy competitive spirit that is evoked. CFDG hopes to be an enjoyable way to faster productivity among its developers and help extend their networks.
